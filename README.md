# Our Notes

This web app allows to maintain notes by group. Each note can have optional one image file. The project was built and deployed using following technologies:
* [Angular](https://angular.io/): frontend framework
* [Angular Firebase](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2): Angular library for Firebase
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): cloud infrastructure
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org): JavaScript runtime environment

For development, clone the repo and run `yarn` to install dependencies, then `ng serve`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
