# Our Notes

This web app allows to maintain notes by group. Each note can have optional image taken from your chosen source - camera, storage or cloud. The project was built and deployed using following technologies:
* [Angular](https://angular.io/): frontend framework
* [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli): CLI for Angular application
* [Angular Firebase](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2): Angular library for Firebase
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): cloud infrastructure
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org): JavaScript runtime environment

Visit [the deployed web app](https://ng-notes-abb75.firebaseapp.com/group/Lee%20family/notes) and play with it! You can create your own group and add note to it.

For development, clone the repo and run `yarn` to install dependencies, then `ng serve`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
